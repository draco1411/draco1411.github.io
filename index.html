            <p>
                Here, you will be walked through the steps of opening a card at either 
                <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/student-credit-card/" target="_blank">Discover</a> or
                <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/students/" target="_blank">Capital One</a>,
                although the principles are general enough to apply to most credit cards from most providers. While special 
                attention will be given to the reasons <em>why</em> credit cards are such a useful finical instrument, the main focus will 
                be <i>how</i> i.e. practical use on a daily/monthly basis.

            <b>Who Should Read This:</b> (College) Students over 18 years old with income (a job presumably) 
            who have <b>no</b> credit and are interested 
            in building credit via credit card. This is not about leveraging credit or churning. This is also basic stuff only. You 
            are encouraged/required to do your own research on everything presented here. Links are never affiliate, and will 
            take you to sources expanding on the subject more or referencing a particular item. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Why
        </h2>

        <p>
            Credit cards provide a convenient and widely accepted method of establishing credit, a measure of 
            "trustworthiness" one has when borrowing money. This score is essential for future financial opportunities, 
            such as obtaining loans (personal/business, mortgage), renting an apartment, or getting favorable interest rates. Employers
            have also been known to 
            <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/can-employers-see-your-credit-score/" target="_balnk">glance at credit scores.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Important: </b>The irresponsible use of credit cards can lead to significant financial stress and negative consequences 
            for individuals and their families. It is crucial to use credit cards responsibly, pay bills on time, and only spend 
            within one's means. By exercising caution and discipline with credit card usage, individuals can avoid potential 
            pitfalls and maintain better financial stability and well-being in the long run. 
        <h2>
            How
        </h2>

        <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieg0bZ-zqE0" target="_blank">
        A helpful YouTube video that sums this all up, and explains it better than me
        </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1: </b>Find a suitable credit card. For working students with no credit history, and no other negative 
            outstanding financial obligations, I typically recommend the student cards from either 
            <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/students/" target="_blank">Capital One</a>,
            or
            <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/student-credit-card/" target="_blank">Discover,</a>
            as no credit score is required for approval and all offer pretty good cashback rewards. These are also both established 
            companies with a strong reputation. <br>
            <br> 
            There is nothing wrong with a
            <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/secured/" target="_blank">Secured Card</a>
            if you really want to ease into owning a credit card. You'd put a dollar amount down (that you would get back after upgrading
            or closing on good terms) and build credit that way. <br>
            The following should be considered for any card:
            <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
                <b>Annual Fee: </b>For a first card, there is no reason to pay for the extra perks an annual fee offers, which 
                are targeted for more established borrowers. But don't scoff at annual fees
                <sup><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0711/credit-cards-should-you-ever-pay-an-annual-fee.aspx" 
                        target="_blank">a</a>
                </sup>; serious users find great deals on cashback and travel points with certain card. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Credit Limit: </b>This is how much the lender has agreed to lend to you. 
                Introductory limits for student cards are usually in the $500 neighborhood
                <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
                <span class="sidenote">We will see shortly why the usable credit one should expect to spend is only around 
                    10% of this limit.</span> <br>
                <br>
                <b>APR: </b> APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the interest rate one accrues on debts. For credit cards, its rather high,
                and can add up quickly. Credit card companies are required to give borrowers at least 21 days to pay off their debts 
                before incurring interest. Thus, by simply paying every bill on time, APR becomes rather irrelevant. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Rewards: </b>Take a good look at the cashback percentages for different cards, along with other perks. Note that
                private companies like Delta Airlines or Amazon offer their own cards too with some pretty nice looking perks, but 
                typically come with a higher APR. I like to stick to the raw cashback for simplicity. Again, the main point of all this
                is to build credit, not leverage massive amounts of money. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Step 2: </b>Get the card. For some reason, people get caught up here. It comes down to clicking through the website 
            and filling in the necessary boxes. Information like name, age, yearly income, etc are asked. I recalling being called on
            the phone by Discover when I opened my first card. Maybe be ready for that idk. The application will take a few days and 
            you will be notified if you are approved. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 3: </b>Activate the card through the website or the app after it is mailed to you. Keep all the fine text 
            documents. The card is now ready to use, but the next few steps are the really important ones. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 4: </b><u>Use the card only for small purchases that you would make anyway</u>, <b>never exceeding more than 30% of 
                your credit limit.</b> That is, if your limit is $500, you really have an implicit limit of $150. 
            This is because <em>credit utilization</em> or how much of your credit you are using, plays a big 
            part in calculator credit score. (A full breakdown is at the end of this document). For sort of abstract reasons,
            credit companies are much more confident that you will pay them back when you are only using a fraction of the money allotted 
            to you. This happens to be 30%, but the generally accepted limit is around  
            <b>10%</b><sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/how-much-of-my-credit-card-limit-should-i-use/#:~:text=Traditional%20wisdom%20suggests%20credit%20scores,impact%20on%20your%20credit%20score." target="_blank">b</a></sup>
            for most new card users 
            making small purchases. Thus your $500 credit limit should really be look at like $50 borrowed at any one time. This 
            makes the card perfect for small things over once in a while, like coffee or a bagel. I have a full breakdown of my 
            credit cards, usage, and philosophy later for those interested. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 5: </b>Set up automatic payments. Assuming you are only spending money you already have i.e. for small purchases 
            that you would make anyway, having the payments being taken directly out of your bank account takes the stress of having 
            to remember to pay the bill every month. It is important, then, that you have sufficient funds in your bank account at all 
            times when using a credit card. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 6: </b>Don't close the card. Even if you stop using it entirely, keep the card open. The length of credit is a factor
            that plays into your scorecard when calculating your score. The longer your credit history, the better. This is another
            reason why you are doing this when you are still in college and not in your mid 20's; those 5-8 years make a huge 
            difference.

            My Credit Card Breakdown
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have currently 2 credit cards. The 
            <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/student-credit-card/it-card.html" target="_blank">Discover It&reg; Student Cash 
                Back</a>
            and the 
            <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savor-dining-rewards/" target="_blank">Capital One Savor Rewards</a>. 
            I applied for the Discover card when I was 18 and got approved after a phone call. I do not remember what I was 
            making at the time, but I was asked for this information, along with my cost of living I believe. 
            This was before they had a dedicated student card like they do today. I recall getting a phone call before getting 
            approved, but for the Capital One card, I 
            just filled out my information and got approved on the next step on the website. This was after establishing a good credit 
            score, however. <br>
            <br>
            My credit limit for Discover is <b>$1750</b> and <b>$3000</b> for Capital One. Woodman's Grocery Store only takes Discover 
            so I use that for all my groceries. This amounts to around $200/month on the discover card. 
            (I know this technically puts me at ~22%
            for credit utilization, but still comfortably under 30%). I use the Capital One card for many other small purchases, but I
            still pay in cash when I can. It should be noted that I would not pay for something with a credit card if I wouldn't 
        </p>
        <h2>
            What Makes the Credit Score
        </h2>
        <p>
            A credit score is a prediction of your credit behavior, such as how likely you are to pay a loan back on time, 
            based on information from your credit reports.<sup><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-credit-score-en-315/" target="_blank">c</a></sup>
            It is bases on a scale from 300 to 850 broken down as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent: 800 - 850</li>
                <li>Very Good: 740 - 799</li>
                <li>Good: 670 - 739</li>
                <li>Fair: 580 - 669</li>
                <li>Poor: 300 - 579</li>
            </ul>
            Anything over 740 is perfectly fine. You will be hard pressed to find a lender that will deny you at 760 that 
            will approve you at 840. Formally, the Credit Score is calculated as follows: 
            <ol>
                <li><b>Payment History (~35%):</b>Payment history defines how consistently you've made your payments on time. 
                    This is the most important contributor to your credit score. </li>
                <li><b>Amount Owed (~30%):</b> The total amount of debt you have. 
                    The lower the amount of outstanding debt, the higher the credit score.</li>
                <li><b>Length of Credit History (~15%):</b> Your credit history is based on the length of time you've had 
                    credit accounts open in your name. A longer credit history can help your credit score. If 
                    you've had a credit card open for a long time, it makes good sense to continue using that card responsibly 
                    to maintain a good score.</li>
                <li><b>New Credit (~10%):</b> Recent credit inquiries and new accounts</li>
                <li><b>Credit Mix (~10%):</b> Different types of credit, like credit cards and loans</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            I choose to present this information last because it is baked into the steps. Knowing this, or course, lets you create your 
            own plan of attack regarding credit scores.
